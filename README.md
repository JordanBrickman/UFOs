# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
  We have been tasked to create a webpage and dynamic table with in-depth analysis on UFO sightings, by allowing users to filter the data by selected criteria, for date, city, state, country, and shape. 
  
## Results:
  This webpage allows a user to scroll through individual sightings, but with the filter criteria we included, the user can now search for a specific city, state, etc. to answer statistical information, such as number of sighting in a city, how mny triangle shaped UFOs are sighted, or however somone would like to summarize and focus the data to meet their needs. 

## Summary:
  While this webpage allows someone to filter and quantify data, it fails to allow a user to sort the data, except by date. As seen in the below image, duration and shape may be a critical sorting criteria and that is simply unavailable with this webpage.

  Some further devlopment to this page, would be to include interactive links and additional sorting features. Both would assit others in viewing the data as well as seeking additional data if needed.
